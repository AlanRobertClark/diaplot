Support for diaplot().

20180?.txt are the monthly data files of Blood Glucose, Basal Insulin
(Optisulin, aka Lantus, hence `L'), and Bolus Insulin (Apidra).

There is no reason why this should not work for mg/dl (American) units, but
diaplot() has been coded with mmol/l in mind.

The date-and-time stamp is inserted into the 20180?.txt files via a simple
abbreviation in the vim() editor:

  iab <expr> 2018/05/19 19h20 strftime("%Y/%m/%d %Hh%M")

Auxiliary octave m-files are arcmakemenu.m which is used to construct the
event-driven menu auto-tag-based callback switchyard system. This is
available at: 

  https://github.com/AlanRobertClark/arcmakemenu.git  

Also printEpsPng.m which auto-labels the .eps and .png files using the
filename supplied. The .eps is useful for vector-based printing, the .png
for raster-based web-browsing etc.

Finally, chooseDate.m assists in accepting a date input for the Start and
End of the plottable data.

Screenshots are scrn01.png and scrn02.png.

File Saved outputs are in 201801*.{eps,png}
