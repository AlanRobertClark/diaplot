% 
% GUI is created with a CallBack event-driven interface, handled via a
% SwitchYard, all through this single file.
%
% External requirements are chooseDate, printEpsPng, and arcmakemenu.
%
% diaplot() reads files, entries starting the line with a valid
% Date-and-time stamp: 2018/05/14 08h34 followed by a Blood Glucose reading
% in mmol/l, a bolus injection, a basal injection(suffixed with L for
% Lantus), or any combination of the above! Comments on meals etc follow.
% Any line not following the above is ignored.
%
% Plots are Blood Glucose versus time, a daily mean and standard deviation
% quadrant plot (High/low vs Stable/Unstable), Insulin versus time,
% Total Daily Dose (bolus, just add the basal :-) versus time, and a Blood
% Glucose versus time-of-day (line per day).
%
% The mean/std.dev. dot-per-day and BG vs time-of-day. line per day are
% clickable, and the actual date corresponding to the dot/line appears in
% the plot title.
%
% The plots are saveable (just give the filname, without extension, and an
% .eps and .png version is saved for printing and web-viewing) and the date
% range is settable within the data that is loaded. 
%
% Data files are concatenated, so many can be read in sequence. (They are
% not subsequently sorted :-)
